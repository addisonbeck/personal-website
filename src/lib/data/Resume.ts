	"I have spent 8 years working on a diverse array of engineering teams. Most of my professional experience has been in the Microsoft ecosystem writing C#, building for Azure cloud services using industry best practices like infrastructure as code and Kubernetes, and using modern front in technologies like Angular to deliver great user experiences. I love to pioneer new process and technology adoption at the places I work, and have a reputation for being someone that can be valuably innovative. I've been working remotely since early 2020, and have spent a good deal of time helping organizations successfully manage that evolution in how engineering teams do work. I have experience working on all sorts of team sizes from the smallest startup to large corporations, and enjoy the unique aspects of each shade.";
