    This website, <a href="/">storybook.addisonbeck.com</a> is a peek behind the curtain at the code style & visual design used during development of my porfolio site, <a target="_blank" href="https://addisonbeck.com">addisonbeck.com</a>.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://storybook.js.org">Storybook</a> is a free and open source frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It's great for encouraging developers to stick to concise, reusable components when organizing code. My component library is organized into two main chunks: "Controls" which are single-use tools (like a button or a code editor), and "Components" that make use of multiple Controls to build pages.
